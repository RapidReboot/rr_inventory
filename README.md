# Overview

Welcome to the Rapid Reboot Inventory System

## Getting Started

Due to Github only allowing static site Generation you will need to create all of the suppliers as well as the boxes on your own localhost.
After creating new supplier pages commit the changes to this repository so that Github can rebuild the website with the new pages pre-rendered.

1. Create products for everything that we will want to be shipping.

2. Go through and add the photos and how many you have on hand as well as how many you need.

3. Navigate to the suppliers page and set all the different products to the correct supplier.
Each supplier will be able to submit more products and update the "on hand" number. 

4. create accounts in Supabase AND in the permissions page in the website.

Supplier Creation Notes: 

When creating supplier accounts USE EMAILS THAT END WITH THE SUPPLIER NAME. For example, examplesupplier@Suppliername.com. @gmail.com, hotmail, and other account names will not work.

All supplier names must be lowercase and no spaces.

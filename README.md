# Overview

Welcome to the Rapid Reboot Inventory System

## Getting Started

1. Create products for everything that we will want to be shipping.

2. Go through and add the photos and how many you have on hand as well as how many you need.

3. Navigate to the suppliers page and set all the different products to the correct supplier. Each supplier will be able to submit more products and update the "on hand" number. 

4. create accounts in Supabase AND in the permissions page in the website.

(NOTE: When creating supplier accounts USE EMAILS THAT END WITH THE SUPPLIER NAME. For example, examplesupplier@Suppliername.com. @gmail.com, hotmail, and other account names will not work.)

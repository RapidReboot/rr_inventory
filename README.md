# Overview

Welcome to the Rapid Reboot Inventory System

## Getting Started

First thing we need to do is create products for everything that we will want to be shipping.

After all of the products are created, go through and add the photos and how many you have on hand as well as how many you need.

Go to the suppliers tab and also add in all the suppliers (this will be used to add more products in the future).

Add in a warehouse account in the Supabase Auth. Using the same email, add an account in the accounts site and set the permissions.

## Upcoming Updates

1. Adding in a faster way to scan products
2. Automate the Admin to Supplier email request system.
3. Adding in event logs.
